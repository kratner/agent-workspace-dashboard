# Agent Workspace Dashboard

**By Keith Ratner** · [github.com/kratner](https://github.com/kratner)

See every Claude Code session you have running, as a Kanban board or a list, and spot the one that's waiting on you.

## Features

- **Kanban and List views.** Sessions are grouped by state: Waiting on you, Working, Idle and Ended. Switch views in the header; the dashboard remembers your choice for each workspace.
- **Know what needs you.** A session waiting for your reply or approval gets its own column, a highlighted card and a count in the status bar. The card says what it's waiting for, such as a permission prompt or an open dialog.
- **Search.** Filter either view as you type, by title, prompt, folder, where it runs or state. Matches are highlighted.
- **Search your whole history.** Switch on **History** to search every past Claude Code session on the machine, including what its subagents did, and resume any of them.
- **Live.** Cards move as sessions change state. You never need to refresh.
- **Every session, wherever it runs.** It shows Claude Code panels in VS Code, the CLI in a terminal and background agents, across all your project folders.
- **Click to open.** Clicking a card brings a session in this window to the front: its Claude Code tab, or the terminal it's running in. An ended session is resumed. For a session running elsewhere, it tells you where.
- **Resume ended sessions.** **Copy resume** puts the `claude --resume` command for that session on your clipboard.
- **Two looks.** The KR brand (black and yellow) by default, or follow your VS Code color theme.
- **Easy to install and update.** One line installs it; after that it checks for new releases and updates itself on request.
- **Read-only and local.** It reads files Claude Code already writes on your machine. It never starts, stops or changes a session, and none of your data leaves the machine. The history index is stored locally, in the extension's own storage. Its only network request is the daily update check, which asks GitHub for the latest release; you can turn it off.

## Install

The extension isn't on the Visual Studio Marketplace yet, so it's installed from this repository's [Releases](https://github.com/kratner/agent-workspace-dashboard/releases). Run one line:

**Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kratner/agent-workspace-dashboard/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

**macOS / Linux**:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kratner/agent-workspace-dashboard/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Then run **Developer: Reload Window** in VS Code.

The installer:

1. downloads the latest release
2. checks it against the SHA-256 checksum GitHub publishes
3. installs it with VS Code's `code` command

If `code` isn't on your PATH on macOS, run **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH** in VS Code first.

**Manual install:** download the `.vsix` from the [latest release](https://github.com/kratner/agent-workspace-dashboard/releases/latest), then run `code --install-extension <file>.vsix`. Or in VS Code: Extensions view → **…** menu → **Install from VSIX…**

To build from source instead, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md#install-from-source).

## Updates

- **Automatic check:** about once a day, the extension asks GitHub whether there's a newer release. If there is, a notification offers:
  - **Update:** downloads it, verifies the checksum, installs it, and offers to reload the window.
  - **Release Notes.**
  - **Skip This Version.**
- **Any time:** run **Agent Workspace: Check for Updates**, or run the install line again.
- **To turn the automatic check off,** set `agentWorkspace.checkForUpdates` to `false`.

## Getting started

1. Have [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed, as the VS Code extension, the CLI, or both.
2. Open the dashboard:
   - click the robot icon in the status bar, or
   - run **Agent Workspace: Open Dashboard** from the Command Palette.
3. Start or continue a Claude Code session. Its card appears within a few seconds.

## Searching

Type in the search box in the header, or press `/` or Ctrl+F (⌘F on macOS) to jump to it. Both views filter as you type.

- **What it searches:** each session's title, last prompt, folder path, where it runs (VS Code, Terminal, Background) and state (Waiting on you, Working, Idle, Ended). So `waiting` or `terminal` works as a query too.
- **Several words:** a session must contain all of them. `api waiting` finds the waiting session in the `api` folder.
- **Matches are highlighted.** In the List view, which has no prompt column, a prompt that matched appears under the title while you search.
- **Your search stays** when you switch tabs and come back. Press Esc in the box to clear it.
- **Scope:** search covers the sessions on the dashboard, meaning running ones plus those ended within `agentWorkspace.endedWithinHours`. To go further back, switch on History.

### Searching history

Click **History** next to the search box. While it's on, a **From history** section lists matching past sessions below the current ones, newest first.

- **What it searches:** every Claude Code session on this machine. For each one it reads the title, the folder and **every prompt you typed**, not just the last one. It doesn't search Claude's replies or tool output.
- **Results:** each row shows the session's title, folder, date and the line that matched. Click a row to resume the session, or use **Copy resume** to get the terminal command.
- **Subagents:** work done inside a subagent counts too. A match there appears under its parent session, as **↳ Found in subagent: *task description***, with the matching line. If several subagents match, the first one is shown with **+N more subagents** to expand. Untick **Include subagents** to search only top-level sessions.
- **Lots of matches:** up to 150 results all show. Above that you see the 25 most recent first, with a **Show all** button; the rest then load as you scroll. The `agentWorkspace.historyResultThreshold` setting moves that cut-off anywhere from 100 to 200.
- **Indexing:**
  - The first time you search history, the extension builds an index of your transcripts in the background, with a progress line. On a 1 GB history it took under 2 seconds.
  - After that it only reads what's new, and the index is cached between restarts.
  - It's stored only on this machine, in the extension's own storage.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Agent Workspace: Open Dashboard** | Opens the dashboard in an editor tab, or brings it to the front |
| **Agent Workspace: Refresh Sessions** | Re-reads session files immediately |
| **Agent Workspace: Check for Updates** | Checks GitHub for a newer release and offers to install it |

## Settings

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agentWorkspace.appearance` | `brand` | `brand` is the KR black-and-yellow look. `vscode` follows your color theme; use it with light themes. |
| `agentWorkspace.endedWithinHours` | `24` | How far back to show ended sessions. `0` hides them. |
| `agentWorkspace.showStatusBar` | `true` | Show the working and waiting counts in the status bar |
| `agentWorkspace.historyResultThreshold` | `150` | History search: above this many matches (100–200), show the 25 most recent first, with a button to show all |
| `agentWorkspace.checkForUpdates` | `true` | Check GitHub for a newer release about once a day and offer to install it |

## How it works

Claude Code keeps a small status file for each running session (`~/.claude/sessions/`) and a transcript for every session (`~/.claude/projects/`). The dashboard watches those files and turns each session into a card:

- **Title:** the session's own title.
- **Last prompt.**
- **Folder.**
- **Where it runs:** VS Code, Terminal or Background.
- **Last activity:** how long ago.

If you've set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, the dashboard reads that folder instead of `~/.claude`.

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.94 or newer.
- Claude Code on the same machine.
- Built for Windows and macOS. Tested on Windows so far.

## Known limitations

- **The status files aren't an official API.** Claude Code's session status files are internal and undocumented, so a Claude Code update could change them. The dashboard reads them defensively: a status it doesn't recognise shows as Idle.
- **Sessions in other windows or terminals.** The dashboard can't switch to another VS Code window or a terminal. It tells you where the session is running instead.
- **Claude Code only, for now.** Other agent systems such as Copilot or ChatGPT can be added as sources later; see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Release notes and roadmap

- **Releases:** every version, with its `.vsix` and notes, is on the [Releases page](https://github.com/kratner/agent-workspace-dashboard/releases).
- **What changed:** see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
- **What's next:** see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). The next milestone is publishing to the Visual Studio Marketplace.
